# Practical_Machine_Learning
Course project for the Practical Machine Learning course in Coursera

This is the final project for Courseraâ€™s Practical Machine Learning course, as part of the Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University.
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbitwe, in this project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise using as predictor the classe variable. For this purpose, we will run 4 different models using k-folds cross validation and compare their overall accuracy by using a validation set randomly selected from the training data. Based on the accuracy, we use the best model to predict 20 cases using the test dataset.

Files: MLReport.Rmd is the r-markdown for the write-up, MLReport.md is the markdown file (use this for github) MLReport.R contains the barebone code for the models and prediction
